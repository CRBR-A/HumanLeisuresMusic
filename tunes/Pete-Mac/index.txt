## Paul Hardy's Pete Mac Tunebook

This tunebook contains tunes written or extended by Pete Mac, who wishes them to be freely used.

Pete says: "I play piano accordion, melodeon and English Concertina. I ran a folk dance and barn dance band for
40 years, in Cambridgeshire and then in Devon where I now live. I wrote these tunes for use in the bands, and am
pleased if others play them. I still lead bands and workshops occasionally, mostly in the Camping and
Caravanning Club 'Folk Group' which has been a lifetime involvement, and of which I am a founder member."

Original tunebook of 19 October 2023. This version of 8 November 2023.
