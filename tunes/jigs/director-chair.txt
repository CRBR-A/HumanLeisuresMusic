% This tunebook contains tunes written or extended by Pete Mac, who wishes 
% them to be freely used. Pete says: "I play piano accordion, melodeon and 
% English Concertina. I ran a folk dance and barn dance band for 40 years, in 
% Cambridgeshire and then in Devon where I now live. % I wrote these tunes for 
% use in the bands, and am pleased if others play them. I still lead bands and 
% workshops occasionally, mostly in the Camping and Caravanning Club 'Folk 
% Group' which has been a lifetime involvement, and of which I am a founder 
% member."
